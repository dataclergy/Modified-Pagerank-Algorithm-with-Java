# Modified-Pagerank-Algorithm-with-Java
With the continuous increase in the volume of published information, accessing relevant information in an ethically sound and timely manner remains a controversial topic. The ethical controversy borders on the choice of parameters used for page ranking and has led to the implementation of varying algorithms with different bias. On the timely access to relevant information, discussions have been on how best to deploy computing resources for optimal results.
This example introduces some modifications to the popular PageRank Algorithm (PRA) and provides scalability insights. The Modified PageRank Algorithm (MPRA) analyses the domain in-links and out-links of an assigned web graph, calculating weights for functional links and taking return (give- and-take) links into account. Non-functional links are excluded from further analysis and no additional weight is assigned to pages with give-and-take hyperlinks. A Distributed Hadoop MapReduce framework was adopted for parallel and timely execution of the MPRA. To gain insight on scalability, the MPRA was executed using multi-node Hadoop clusters with number of workers ranging from two to eight.
By excluding non-functional links and putting no-weight increment constraint on return links, the MPRA produced a better result than the standard PRA in determining page relevance. Also, there is linearity in performance at scale; execution time reduces as more workers are added.
